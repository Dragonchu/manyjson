**Linear Issue:** [MJ-21](https://linear.app/json-file-and-schema-save-and-view/issue/MJ-21/fix-black-screen-problem-when-build-electron-app)

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, the issue was **NOT** a technical failure but a UX problem:

- ✅ **App was working correctly**: HTML loaded, Vue mounted, IPC working, store initialized
- ❌ **Very dark theme** (`#0a0a0a`) appeared completely black on some displays
- ❌ **No loading indicators** during app initialization
- ❌ **Lack of visual feedback** for users

## 🛠️ Changes Made

### 1. Loading States & Visual Feedback
- **Added loading spinner** in `index.html` - shows immediately when page loads
- **Added loading overlay** in `Home.vue` - displays during app initialization  
- **Professional styling** matching the app's design system
- **Visible against dark background** with proper contrast

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Vue app error handling** with user-visible error messages
- **Electron main process** error handling for file loading
- **File existence checks** before loading HTML
- **Fallback error pages** with proper styling

### 3. Robust Initialization
- **Async/await patterns** for proper loading sequence
- **Try-catch blocks** around critical operations
- **Loading state management** in Vue components
- **Graceful error recovery** with user feedback

## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Application
- `src/main.ts` - Enhanced Vue app initialization with error handling
- `src/views/Home.vue` - Added loading overlay during initialization

## 📸 Before vs After

### Before
